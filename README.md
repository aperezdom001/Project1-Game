//// PROTECT TITLE: THE POWER OF DREAMS & NIGHTMARES ////name may change

Synopsis: 
The player is transferred into a peculiar realm between dreams and 
nightmares one day in their sleep.  Player wakes up to creatures of
day and night chasing them with the intent to destroy them.

The player fights against these enemies by using their strongest dream (strength)
and nightmare (weakness) to defeat them.

There will be four rounds in total.
Dream Attack: less damage, but only one enemy attacks you.
Nightmare Attack: more damage, but two enemies attack you at the same time.

Use your dream and nightmare to your advantage to defeat them and then figure out
how you will need to ge home!


//// MOTIVATION ////

In this game, I wanted to create something I do not see very often in games. I like the action of using your weaknesses
and not only your strengths as a way for the player/character to defend themselves and defeat whoever is in their way.
